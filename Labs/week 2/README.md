# Week 02 Lab — Variables, Conditionals & Loops

## Brief Description
This lab focused on solving real-world problems using Python fundamentals. 
I wrote programs to track expenses, recommend internet packages, monitor temperatures, and simulate loan eligibility using logical conditions and loops.

## Concepts Practiced
- Variables and data types
- if / elif / else decision-making
- for and while loops
- Counters and accumulators
- Compound conditions (and)

## Challenges Faced
One challenge was applying multiple conditions correctly without logical errors. 
Understanding how loops interact with conditions also required careful thinking.

## AI/ML Relevance
These skills are important in AI and data analysis because AI systems rely on input → processing → output logic. 
Conditionals and loops are used when analyzing datasets and applying rules to data.
