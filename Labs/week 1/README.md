# Lab 01 – GitHub Setup & First Push

## What this lab does
In this lab, I set up a GitHub repository for the AI-216 course, created the first Python script (`hello_ai216.py`), and practiced basic Git workflows including creating branches, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub. This lays the foundation for version control and collaborative coding.

## Key commands used
- `git init` – initialize a new Git repository
- `git add .` – stage changes for commit
- `git commit -m "..."` – commit staged changes with a message
- `git push` – push commits to GitHub
- `git checkout -b <branch>` – create and switch to a new branch
- `git merge <branch>` – merge a branch into the current branch

## What I learned
- How to initialize and configure a Git repository
- How to stage, commit, and push changes to GitHub
- How to use branches for separate work and merge them back

## AI/ML relevance
Using Git and GitHub ensures **reproducibility** of code and experiments in AI/ML projects. Branch workflows allow **collaboration** without overwriting others' work, which is essential for team-based AI/ML development.
