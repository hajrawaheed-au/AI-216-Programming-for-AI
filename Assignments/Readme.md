## Assignment 01: Python Logic & Problem Solving  

---

## Overview

This assignment focuses on applying basic Python concepts to solve logical problems.  
The tasks were completed using variables, conditional statements, loops, and logical operators without using external libraries.

## Problem 1: Monthly Budget Analyzer

The program calculates total monthly expenses (rent, food, transport, utilities) and checks whether the total is within the budget limit of 60,000 PKR.

**Concepts Used:**  
Variables, arithmetic operations, `if-else` condition.

---

## Problem 2: Electricity Bill Estimator

The program takes electricity units as input and determines the billing category:
- ≤ 100 → Basic Rate  
- 101–300 → Standard Rate  
- > 300 → High Usage Rate  

**Concepts Used:**  
User input, `if-elif-else` conditions.

## Problem 3: Attendance Analysis

The program analyzes a list of attendance percentages and counts how many students meet the required attendance (≥ 75%) and how many do not.

**Concepts Used:**  
Lists, loops, counters, conditional logic.

## ✅ Problem 4: Scholarship Eligibility System

The program checks scholarship eligibility based on:
- CGPA ≥ 3.5  
- Family income ≤ 80,000 PKR  

A loop and compound condition (`and`) are used to count eligible students.

**Concepts Used:**  
Compound conditions, loops, logical operators.

## Problem 5 (Bonus): Sensor Alert System

The program identifies sensor readings outside the safe range (20–80), counts total alerts, and calculates the percentage of alert readings.

**Concepts Used:**  
Accumulators, logical operator (`or`), percentage calculation.
