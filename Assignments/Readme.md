# Assignment 01 – Programming for AI

This assignment focuses on using basic Python concepts like variables, conditionals, and loops to solve real-world problems. The goal was to build logical thinking and write clear, simple Python code without external libraries.

## Problem 1: Monthly Budget Analyzer

**Explanation**  
This program tracks monthly expenses (rent, food, transport, utilities) and checks if the student stays within the budget.

**Logic Used**  
- Store expenses in variables  
- Add them to calculate total expense  
- Compare total with budget (60,000 PKR) using if–else  
- Show "Within Budget" or "Over Budget"

**Challenges Faced**  
Making sure the total expense calculation was correct.

## Problem 2: Electricity Bill Estimator

**Explanation**  
This program finds the electricity billing category based on units used.

**Logic Used**  
- Take units as input  
- Use if–elif–else for ranges  
- Display the correct category

**Challenges Faced**  
Setting correct unit ranges without overlap.

## Problem 3: Class Attendance Analysis

**Explanation**  
This program checks which students meet the 75% attendance rule.

**Logic Used**  
- Store attendance in a list  
- Loop through the list  
- Count students ≥75% and <75%

**Challenges Faced**  
Updating counters correctly inside the loop.

## Problem 4: Scholarship Eligibility System

**Explanation**  
This program checks scholarship eligibility using CGPA and income.

**Logic Used**  
- Use two lists (CGPA and income)  
- Loop through both lists  
- Apply condition: CGPA ≥3.5 AND income ≤80,000  
- Count eligible students

**Challenges Faced**  
Using compound conditions correctly.

## Problem 5 (Bonus): Sensor Alert System

**Explanation**  
This program detects unsafe sensor readings.

**Logic Used**  
- Loop through readings list  
- If reading <20 or >80 → alert  
- Count alerts and find percentage

**Challenges Faced**  
Calculating percentage properly.
